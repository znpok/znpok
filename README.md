Hi there, I am a penultimate year student in NTU pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering (Robotics & Mechatronics Stream), with a Second Major in Business. As an aspiring Robotics Software Engineer, I have taken up a few projects, such as a low-cost earthquake warning system prototype and a smart bus stop prototype powered by an Arduino.
